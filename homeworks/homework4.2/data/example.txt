Example scenario for the adapter template:

RapidTransit employees currently maintain manual passenger and ticket records by manually entering
information into text files. If an adapter is used for my solution, it can be applied to migrate
existing records into the database for speed and compatibility in my project. The Adapter will read
the text file records and convert them into a format that can be stored in the database used by
the new ticket management system.
